We demonstrate a proof-of-concept prototype of a passive capability to identify informal settlements (aka, "slums"). A generalized method applicable to developing-market regions is our goal. We demonstrate using the Johannesburg, SA region. Available information includes satellite imagery, census data, open-source population-density estimates (e.g., Facebook Population-Density Maps), and geographic information about bounadries of political/administrative subdividsions. The approach is a novel combination of machine-learning clustering and a mainstream image-processing method.
