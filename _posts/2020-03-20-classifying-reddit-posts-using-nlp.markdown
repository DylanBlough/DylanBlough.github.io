My grandfather loves history and loves to read about it. He recently started using the internet more and I noticed that he's been saying some pretty out there things! I had a look at his computer at it seems like he's been getting things he reads on /r/conspiracy mixed up with things that he's read on /r/history. To help him tell the difference, I built several classification models to help him understand what topics tend to show up in which subreddits.
